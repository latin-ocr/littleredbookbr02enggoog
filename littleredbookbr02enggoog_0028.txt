= commercial and industrial prosperity of a town, the more rapidly did
tha process of subdirision into craft gilde proceed, keeping pace with
tae neeesse divisions or anons. 1n ne amane towns in venien

tendency of good citizens would be to subordinate their private position

as erait masters to their public duties as members of the corporation. ,
