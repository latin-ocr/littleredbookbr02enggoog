’ some of the ordinances have not become antiquated by the lapsa ol
ages. They hear on the conduct oi the citizens, the duties oi the officials,
the adulteration oi fond, trade, the closing of public honses, the residcnce
of strangers within tha town, persons wandering about ather curiew without
a light, dogs at large, wages and sanitary matters

In addition to the above wa have a record oi the ordinances
issued by the Common Council from time to time. In ¹4³9 (1., p. 86)
Irishman begottm and bom within the country of Ireland were debarred
from admission to the Common Council, which resolution tha Craft of
Hoopers endorsed the same year by an ordinance against the employ-
ment of renen of helani, calling upon au menecea with nair eran
‘¹ to voyde ali such Iryssch seruauntz.” Other ordinandas relate to the
punishment oi those betraying the cnunsel of the Commonaity (1., p. 104),
of townsmen refirsing to attend when summoned to hear proclamatione
(1., p. 105), of those who slander members of the Council (1., p. 149).
and of those leaving the town without permission just before Michaelmas ⁸
(the day of the election oi Officers) (Π., p. 46); others relate to admission
to the franchise (Π., pp. 47, ⁶2), and to the protection oi the tenants of
Chaon-y lands (Π., p. 62); and a stringant order regulates the liveries of
the officials in order to counteract the abuses that had arisen in connection
with tha same (Π., p. 64), wherein the list of those who ara entitled to
wear the town livery is strictly defined. Many other equally important
ordinancas are to he found in the volume, and I quit this section by
' calling special attention to an ordinance made in 1381 for the saie keeping
of all recotds, papers and munimenta touching the Commune (L, p. ιιο).
