In 1461 women were custing men irem work, and complaint is

made (p. ¹2⁷) thet divers persons cf the Weavers' erait employ their

wives, daughters and maidens to work on their own leonis, md m„ .

them to work with other persons, whereby many of the Kings liegcs
likely to dc the King service in his wara and in the defencc of his
land go vagrant and uncccupied and may not have a living ior their

labour. To meet which complaint an ordinanco asscnted to by the
Mayor, Sheriff and &menon Ccuncil is directed against the emplcyment

ci women in the orest cf wasving, and tha next year an ordinance is
asmnnd to against the minen employing “strangers aliens and others
nct born under the King’s obeisance but sabellicus, which be sold tc
them,”² while the Craii cf Hoopers inflicted a heavy penalty cn all who

· employed Irish servants. The Barbers arc legislating against persons other

than masters, their servants or apprentices exercising their mast (p. πῃ),
and attempts are made to enlorce a seven years' apprentioeship (p. ¹4²)-

lhc ordinanccs enrolled in the Little Red Book are invariably
at the instance oi the masters. It is not to be expepted that the views
citha workman would receive much attemion at the hands citha eonnon

' Counoil, so many of whom were erait masters. whatever divergence oi

opinion might ariae between masters and men would naturally-ha settlml
at the common hall citha craft, and a repert oi a crac meeting in
the fifteenth century would he a most interesting record. Knowing
what we do os the sturdy labourers oi the syth century we can hardly
suppose that they accepted in silence tha dictatas oi the masters any

more than their successore of the ninetccnth century. ἢ
