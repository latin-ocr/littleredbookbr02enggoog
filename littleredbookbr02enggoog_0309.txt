granted to the then prior of the

at the said town of Eristol in the
wcek of Pentecost with prisage of

and his successore within and with·
out the burgh as the same Earl
better and more honourablyhad and
hald it And although the prior
and allhissuccessors from thetima
oi the gin and grant aforesaid undl
now, by virtue of the sama gift
and grant and of the confirmations
of divers of our progenitore, have
held and had such fair there with
the prisage aforesaid and with all
other liberties and free customs per·
taining to that fair as freely and
peacefuiiy as the Earl in his day
had it, nevertheless you again in
manifold ways do unjustly impede
our beloved in Christ the present
prior of the aforesaid place from
having and holding the amrseeid -
prisage as he was wont to the grave
prejudice and iniury of him the
present prior, and contrary to the
force and effect of the aforesaid gift,
