scettered throughout the first volume moy be read with interest, especially
the long series et p. 45. From them we leem n great deal of the

duties of those who subscribed them, end consequently of the gevem-

ment of the town. In addition to the oaths of the officere of the town we
find enrolled those required from officials of the Gildo. 'sse “ Clericus
Tundere” on p. 48 hes been a source oi trouble to me. 1 em afraid
‘ 1 too nasny eneruem net no cren of ne lonay ane ne cren or
the Tundred were one end the¹ same from the circumstance thet in the
comprehensive series of oaths beginning at p. 45 the Clerk of the Tolsey

was not included. so my font-note must go among the Corrsgenda.
The oeth is heeded “Sacramentum Clerici Tundere” and his office is

called “le Toundrye” He swears to enter or cause to be entered the
plens pleeded in the Toundrye, to meintein no ielse pleint, or dismrb

or deley any right, etc. At p. ror, where his duties ere defined. he is ’

called “ Geticus Tundredi.” The words Tundere end Tundrodi ere I
think French end Latin forms of hundred.¹ If my suggestion is accepted,
it fumishes en example of a colloquialism in vogne at Bristol
“t'hundred'’ for “the hundred.” One other official hes puzzled me,
thet is “Mester Leuerance de lez forchez,” who is entitled to e liuery
(11.,· p. 66). Probably he is the hnngmen.

of the politicel history ol Bristol very little is to be gleened
from those peges. Two letters to the Meyer from Edwerd 1v. in 1471,
relating to the seizure of certain citizens and their goods, show thet,
however well affected the merchants generassy were to the house oi
York. the Lancestrians were not without sympathisers (11. pp. 130, ηπ). ⁸
